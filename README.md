The "server.py" contains the codes while the "books.csv" contains the data used for id and sold copies
 My aim was to create a web application in "Heroku" with desired local host by using Ubuntu 16+ and importing data for visualization and  search bar for the book IDs.The aimed name for the application was "BooKKia".
At first, I have tried to use "Heroku" for creating web application by connecting github and Python (pycharm), and command prompt but did not succeed.
So , I have only created the web application without showing the data by using IDE: PyCharm.
