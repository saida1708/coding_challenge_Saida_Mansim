The "server.py" contains the codes while the "books.csv" contains the data used for id and sold copies
 My aim was to create the web application in Heroku by using Ubuntu 16+ and importing data for visualization and  search bar for book IDs.
At first, I have tried to use "Heroku" for creating web application by connecting github and python (pycharm), and command prompt but did not succeed.
So , I have only created the web application without showing the data.
